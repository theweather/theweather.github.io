# Week 8 Notes = Styles and Bootstrapping

## CSS - Inheritance, Selectors, and What Matters The Most To Your Browser

### Nest classes within one another to make child classes that inherit trait from their parents unless they have their own traits.

### The browser prioritizes id styles first, then class styles, then tag styles. Call tags with just the tag name, classes with a . before the name, and IDs with a # before the name (eg name vs .name vs #name).

## Grids in CSS

### Remember that grid lines starts at 1, not zero, so the farthest left or top line (depending on rows or columns) is 1. For 6 columns or rows, there are 7 lines.
