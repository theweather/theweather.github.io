<p>Thinking about how much people love Opportunity, the Mars Rover, how they poured out their love when Opportunity was declared dead, and how much Opportunity was being framed as a person.</p>
<p>The amount to which humans (myself included) anthropomorphize everything around us, in my opinion, is another indicator of the universal need for representation. People need to see themselves in their surroundings and in the creatures around them, to relate to others because they have something in common, both in their day-to-day life and in media. It isn't just a nice-to-have. It is an actual need.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the need for representation is, on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, contained within both the second (safety) and third (belongingness and love) levels. "I am safe" and "I belong" are where several really critical social justice issues are rooted. This also why it's important for kids to be around lots of different sorts of people.</p>
<p>If someone grows up feeling safe and like they belong in a community with diverse representation across many demographics, they are more likely to carry that sense of safety and belonging into their adult lives and into other communities they find as they grow up. Such a person is more likely to be able to relate to a wider variety of people, and (in a moment of gross oversimplification), the more people can relate to one another, the safer and more welcomed everyone can be.</p>
<p>Questions we have to ask ourselves: what are we teaching children now? What are we teaching each other?</p>
