## 3. Explain the test-driven development methodology and process

### Test-driven methodology places the central focus on starting with the tests that the code that is not yet written will need to pass. The overall idea is that the tests are written to requirements, and then the code is written to the tests. Sometimes, one may find (as I did) that one's tests are passed incorrectly, and then one must find out why and fix the test and then fix the code. After writing the code so the test passes, the developer now can go back and improve the initial code they wrote. This changes how developers interact with their code, making sure they've done a certain level of testing before it must be integrated with wider systems and run through QA acceptance processes.

## 7. Explain how HTML pages interpret JavaScript code

### HTML pages can be given a script source that points to a JavaScript page, or it can be given JavaScript directly in a script tag. Javascript can modify the page contents, process data, or other useful actions. 

## 8. Explain how the browser interprets HTML and JavaScript code

### The browser looks at different sections of code for different information. HTML (with or without CSS) is the body formatting of the page, and *can* include the content but doesn't have to. The browser can pull Javascript in that changes the displayed content in the page.
