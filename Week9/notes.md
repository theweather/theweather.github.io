# Week 9 Notes

## This week is going to be about a lot of Asynchronous code, to handle things like how long it takes a server to respond, if at all.

### A lot of what I've done so far is procedural/sequential, ie doing one step at a time. Imperative code.

### Timers can be an example of an asynchronous instruction, with other code in the same block returning before whatever is in the timer returns.

## Promises

### Representing the evetual completion or failure of an asynch action and its resulting values.

### Await is used to wait for a promise; makes it so sequential and async can both be used.

### Async can save a lot of performance and UX in the browser.
