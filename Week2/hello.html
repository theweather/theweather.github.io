  <h1>Hello World!</h1><br>
  <h2>Here's my Hello World! I've elected to included real worlds and fictional, because it makes me happy.</h2>
  <h3>If you, like me, had trouble getting your Mac to allow local file to open in Chrome, open Terminal and run this command:</h3>
  <blockquote>open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files</blockquote>
  <h3>After that, reopen Chrome.</p>

  Things I'm excited to learn CSS for in order to make these pages look nicer include:
  <ul>
    <li>Background and text color things, since the background color HTML I'm used to using from back in the day has since been deprecated.</li>
    <li>Columns and sections.</li>
    <li>Animations!</li>
  </ul>
  Things I need to do first:<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Re-learn basic CSS.</li>
    <li>Establish a good working knowledge of sound and consistent coding practices.</li>
    <li>Decide what kind of project I want to work on.</li>
  </ol>

  Some notes from basic Javascript stuff:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Variable names are case sensitive.</li>
    <li>Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore.</li>
    <li>Name variables in such a way as to increase the visibility/understanding of the users.</li>
    <li>== is Equal Value</li>
    <li>=== is Equal Value and Type</li>
    <li>!= is Does Not Equal</li>
    <li>!== is Does Not Equal Value or Type</li>
    <li>&gt; is Greater Than</li>
    <li>&lt; is Less Than</li>
    <li>&gt;= is Greater Than or Equal To</li>
    <li>&lt;= is Less Than or Equal To</li>
    <li>&& is AND</li>
    <li>|| is OR</li>

  </ul>
