  <h1>Hello World!</h1><br>
  <h2>Here's my Hello World! I've elected to included real worlds and fictional, because it makes me happy.</h2>
  <h3>If you, like me, had trouble getting your Mac to allow local file to open in Chrome, open Terminal and run this command:</h3>
  <blockquote>open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files</blockquote>
  <h3>After that, reopen Chrome.</p>
  For web development purpose, we'll link <a href="https://w3c.org">W3C</a>.
  For Dungeons & Dragons purposes, we'll link <a href="https://critrole.com/">Critical Role</a>.<p>
  Here is a picture of the fictional town called Phandalin.<p>

  Things I'm excited to learn CSS for in order to make these pages look nicer include:
  <ul>
    <li>Background and text color things, since the background color HTML I'm used to using from back in the day has since been deprecated.</li>
    <li>Columns and sections.</li>
    <li>Animations!</li>
  </ul>
  Things I need to do first:<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Re-learn basic CSS.</li>
    <li>Establish a good working knowledge of sound and consistent coding practices.</li>
    <li>Decide what kind of project I want to work on.</li>
  </ol>
